Ascensions of Resonance: Navigating Material Constraints in Creative Expression

This project explores the capabilities of human creativity and expression under varying periods of material constraint through
the visualisation of data related to global forecasts of cobalt consumption into the shape
of an audio waveform. This wavefrom not only represents the increasing demand for cobalt consumption
in relation the exponential development of the electronics industry, but also serves to metaphorically visualise 
our current need to devise creative solutions in order to combat the negative environmental effects created by
such widespread cobalt extraction. This project works to bridge the gap between these two seemingly disparate
temporal periods by subverting the function of a pen plotter and physically engraving this visual representation 
onto the material of rib recording reproduction from the Soviet era.
